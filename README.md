# Surf-Up Analysis

## Overview 

### History 
The purpose of the previous analysis was to run some analysis on the weather dataset of the island of Oahu. To get investors to invest in opening a Surf N’ Shake shop, the weather year-round analysis was needed. 
To serve this purpose, the weather dataset (full-year data) was gathered from different stations, and the data was stored by using SQLite. By using SQLAlchemy the connection between the dataset and database (SQLite database) was achieved. 

To get a better understanding of the trends in the data, all of the station observations were displayed by a plot. In addition to the plot that was provided,  some solid statistical analyses—such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum were calculated to get a summary of different statistics for the amount of precipitation in a year. The analysis of temperature was added and the result of the analysis was visualized. To share the results of those applications with others Flask web frame was used.

### Purpose of this Analysis
This analysis aimed to provide additional information about temperature trends on Oahu before opening the surf shop. The temperature data of Oahu island from the months of June and December was determined to find out if opening a Surf N’ Shake shop is conducive.
